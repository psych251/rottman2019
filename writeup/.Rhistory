###Data Preparation
# I will create a survey on Qualtrics, and link that survey to Mechanical Turk. My survey has 16 questions, and each question has two dosages, so it is actually 32 questions total. All questions are provided in the Rottman 2019 paper. Each participant is presented with 16 moral violations, that vary by domain (harm vs. purity violation) and by . dosage (low vs. high or magnitude vs. frequency). I will use the "Randomizer" function in Qualtrics. To ensure that participants see the appropriate questions.
####Load Relevant Libraries and Functions
# The libraries I need are the useful, all-purpose libraries:
library(foreign) # for reading spss formatted data
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2) # will allow me to create the violin plot
####Import data
data = read.spss("Rottman2019ReplicationData.sav", to.data.frame=T)

#### Data exclusion / filtering
# I will exclude all participants who fail the attention check
# I will exclude participants who did my test twice-in the pilot and in the real study.
# data_filtered = data %>%
#  filter(if failed attention check)
#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
# I can use "mutate" to create additional columns if needed.
